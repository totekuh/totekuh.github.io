Switching from a smartphone to a button phone is aimed at reducing unnecessary screen time, enhancing focus, and fostering a greater sense of presence at the moment. 

It involves letting go of convenient but potentially distracting features like apps, internet browsing, and social media, in favor of a more minimalist, functional approach to mobile communication. 

This change is not just about ditching a device; it's about reorienting how you interact with technology and, by extension, the world around you.

## Goals

- **Enhanced Focus**: By eliminating the constant influx of notifications and the temptation to browse, your ability to focus on tasks should improve.
- **Increased Presence**: Without a smartphone to divert your attention, you'll be more engaged in the current moment, whether you're in a meeting, spending time with loved ones, or simply enjoying some solitude.
- **Improved Navigation Skills**: Relying on traditional methods of finding your way can sharpen your sense of direction and spatial awareness.
- **Better Time Management**: A limited feature set means less time spent on the phone and more time for productive or meaningful activities.
- **Enhanced Security**: With fewer data points being collected, a button phone can be a more secure option for basic needs.

## Approaches

- **Communication Strategy**: Opt for basic calls and SMS for essential communications.
- **Offline Navigation**: Use physical maps or print out directions ahead of time to navigate.
- **Entertainment**: Consider separate devices like an iPod Nano for music, reducing the need for a multi-purpose smartphone.
- **2FA Security**: Utilize hardware tokens or apps on a secure computer for two-factor authentication, instead of SMS.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Social Pressure**: Prepare for questions or skepticism from peers accustomed to seeing everyone with a smartphone.
- **Professional Expectations**: Ensure your workplace is accommodating of your tech choices, and be prepared to explain how you'll remain effective.
- **Emergency Situations**: Make sure you have a plan for emergencies that often rely on smartphone features like GPS.
- **Convenience Trade-offs**: Acknowledge the tasks that will become more challenging without a smartphone and prepare alternatives.

> Your journey away from a smartphone back to a button phone could be a rewarding experience, provided you approach it thoughtfully.

This timeline breaks down what you may experience at different stages.

## Timeline

### 1 Day

The first day will be the most jarring as you try to adjust to a life without instant access to various apps, notifications, and other smartphone functionalities.

#### Withdrawal Symptoms and Mood

You're likely to experience a strong urge to check social media, messages, or news apps. 

Expect mixed emotions, ranging from a sense of liberation to potential irritability stemming from the sudden lack of access.

#### Physiological Effects

You might feel an initial sense of relief, similar to a weight being lifted, or a sense of restlessness or agitation due to the lack of constant digital stimulation.

#### Things to Consider

Minor inconveniences, like missing out on real-time updates or the inability to easily coordinate plans via messenger apps, start to surface.

### 1 Week

By the one-week mark, the initial shock has mostly worn off, but the reality of your new lifestyle choice begins to set in, with its own set of challenges and benefits.

#### Withdrawal Symptoms and Mood

The urge to check the phone should lessen, but may still crop up during idle moments or downtime. 

The initial irritability is likely to have eased, but you might start to feel 'out of the loop.'

#### Physiological Effects

Improved sleep patterns may start to become noticeable, given the reduced screen time, especially before bedtime.

#### Things to Consider

You might find yourself missing out on spontaneous activities or struggling with last-minute changes, as your old go-to tools are no longer in your pocket.

### 2 Weeks

Two weeks in, you're beyond the initial withdrawal phase, but now face the challenge of integrating your new tech habits into a sustainable lifestyle.

#### Withdrawal Symptoms and Mood

The compulsion to check your phone continues to decrease, and you may start to notice that you're generally less anxious.

#### Physiological Effects

Less screen time could result in less eye strain and better posture if you were previously prone to hunching over your smartphone.

The inconvenience of not having real-time maps or quick web searches becomes more apparent, prompting you to seek out alternative solutions.

### 1 Month

At this stage, you're getting accustomed to your new way of life. 

The absence of a smartphone is no longer a daily crisis, and you've found workarounds for most challenges.

Any withdrawal symptoms should largely be gone by now, replaced by a newfound sense of focus and mental clarity.

#### Physiological Effects

Continued improvement in sleep quality and possibly even an increase in physical activity due to less time spent idly scrolling.

By now, you've probably developed new systems for staying organized and informed, although there may be rare instances where the lack of a smartphone presents a significant hurdle.

Half a year in, your button phone lifestyle is now well-established. 

While you've likely faced challenges along the way, you've also reaped a number of psychological and physiological rewards.
