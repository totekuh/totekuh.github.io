Hi! I work as a penetration tester with the focus on low level security research.

My penetration testing experience is wide-ranging, covering areas like automotive embedded systems, IoT, hardware pentesting and reverse engineering as well as web, network and SE.

I created this blog to put all my writings and/or posts in one place and I hope you'll find it useful.

This blog is completely non-commercial. I provide all information free of charge, aiming to contribute to the cybersecurity community and support fellow enthusiasts and professionals in their strive for knowledge.
